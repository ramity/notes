# Operation overview

- Operations that can be performed ()
  - Project
  - Union
  - Intersect
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Join
  - Division

Project: Displays selected columns of a relation (shows unique records).

Project notation: PI (uppercase pi, PI in notes)

```sql
PI Employee
name, salarysq;
```

Union compatibility: Two relations are union compatible if
- Required for union, intersect, and difference.
- They have the same degree
- The corresponding attributes must have the same domain\

---

# Union

Union notation: U

```sql
(PI Employee name) U (PI Student name)
```

Union operation displays all records from both tables, removing any duplicates.

```sql
|R1| = m
|R2| = n

max(m, n) <= |R1 U R2| <= m + n
```

U is commutative:

```sql
(R1 U R2) = (R2 U R1)
```

---

# Intersect

Notation: U upside down (as N in notes)

- Shows only the tuples that are present in both tables

```sql
(PI Employee name) N (PI Student name)
```

```
|R1| = m
|R2| = n

0 <= (R1 N R2) <= min(m, n)
```

Intersection is also commutative:

```sql
(R1 N R2) = (R2 N R1)
```

---

# Difference

Notation: `-`

- `R1 - R2` will show records in R1 that are not present in R2.

```sql
(PI student name) - (PI Employee name)
```

```
|R1| = m
|R2| = n

0 <= |R1 - R2| <= |R1|
```

Difference is not commutative.

---

# Product

Notation: `x`

- Displays all possible combinations of records from both tables

```sql
Employee x Student
```

```
//pseudo code

for rowE in Employee
  for rowS in Student
    //output rowE + rowS
  endfor
endfor
```

Product is commutative

```sql
|R1| = m
|R2| = n

m * n <= |R1 x R2| <= m * n
```

Therefore:

```
|R1 x R2| = m * n
```

Additionally:

```
Deg R1 = k
Deg R2 = l
Deg R1 x R2 = k + 1
```
