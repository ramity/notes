Table 250,000 records

Record size 50 bytes

Page 1kb

Key field size 10 bytes

Pointer size 5 bytes



If a secondary index exists on the key field, how many pages will be read to search for a record given the key field value.



Index:

| ID          | Pointer |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 5           | *       |
| 7           | *       |
| 10          | *       |
| end of page |         |

Pointer goes to record in indexed table



Table has 250,000 records so the index has 250,000 records because the index corresponds to a key field.

Record size in index is 15 bytes

Number of records per page is floor(1024 / 15) = 68

Total index pages is ceiling(250,000 / 68) = 3,677

Index search time is log_2_(3677) ~= 12

If value is found, read one more page (from original table)

​	So in total it would require for 13 pages to be read

If value is not found, nothing more to read

​	So 12 pages max



Comparison:

Heap file: 6250 pages

Sorted file: 14 pages

Index: 12 pages if not found: 13 if found



Primary index:

Built on ordered (sorted) key field

To build a primary index, one must keep the original table sorted

Primary index table will only point to first record per page:



| ID          | Pointer | ...  | ID          | Name |
| ----------- | ------- | ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| 2           | *       |      | 2           | ...  |
|             |         |      | 4           | ...  |
|             |         |      | 7           | ...  |
|             |         |      | End of page |      |
| 8           | *       |      | 8           | ...  |
|             |         |      | 9           | ...  |
|             |         |      | 11          | ...  |
|             |         |      | End of page |      |
| 14          | *       |      | 14          | ...  |
|             |         |      | 16          | ...  |
|             |         |      | 18          | ...  |
| End of page |         |      | End of page |      |



Primary index:

If key field is ordered, a primary index is built.

How many pages will be read while searching for a record based on the key field value?



Record size 15 bytes

​	ID 10 bytes

​	Pointer 5 bytes

Number of records/page = floor(1024 / 15) = 68

Number of records in index = number of pages in the table

Number of records per page = floor(1024 / 50) = 20 records/page

Number of pages in table = ceiling(250,000 / 20) = 12,500 pages

Therefore the number of records in index = 12,500 records

Number of pages in index = ceiling(12,500 / 68) = 184 pages

Index search : log_2_(184) = 8 pages

​	Therefore + 1 page as you must read the pointed page = 9 pages max



Dense index : index has the same number of records as the table

Nondense index  : Index has smaller number of records than table



Table has 5000 records

Record size 100 bytes

Page size 512 bytes

Key field size 5 bytes

Pointer size 4 bytes



Common calculations:

Number of records per page = floor(512 / 100) = 5 records/page

Number of pages of table = ceiling(5,000 / 5) = 1,000 pages



Heap file:

Average pages on search: 1,000 / 2 = 500 pages



Sorted file:

Max pages on search: ceiling(log_2_(1000)) = 10



Index:

Record size: 9 bytes

Number of records/page = floor(512 / 9) = 56 records/page



Secondary index:

Total records = table records = 5,000 records

Total pages in index = ceiling(5,000 / 56) = 90 pages

To search index max number of pages to be read = ceiling(log_2_(90)) = 7 pages required to be read

​	If the record is found 7 + 1 = 8 pages required to be read

​	If the record is not found, 7 pages



Primary index:

Number of records = number of pages in the table = 1,000 records

Total pages = ceiling(1,000 / 56) = 18

To search the index, the number of pages to be read = ceiling(log_2_(18)) = 5

​	1 page from table, therefore a total number of 6 pages
