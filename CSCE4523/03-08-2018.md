# Database Design

Databases are stored in disks

- RAM has less space
- RAM is volatile

Page

- The minimum unit of data transfer

Ro read/write a page:

1. Move R/W head to right track
2. Move R/W head to right section
3. Do data transfer

Page size = 1024 bytes

Record size : fixed length records = "100 bytes"

Number of records per page = 1024 / 100 = 10 unspanned records
