# Database on a HD perspective



To retrieve a record the following are involved:

- R/W head moving to correct track
- Disk rotates to bring right sector under the R/W head
- Data is read or written



Mechanical drives are slow (in comparison to flash and/or NAND based storage devices)



Data are stored in locks

Assume block size is 1024 bytes (1kb)



- Unspanned records:
  - Assuming records size is 200 bytes
  - Number of records per block floor(1024/200) = max of 5 records per block



For this class it can be said that`Block = page` and their wordings can be used interchangeably.



How many pages/blocks to be read to find a record with the following:

- Table with 250,000 records
- Per size 50 bytes
- Records are not ordered (heap file)
- Block size 1024 bytes

Number of records per page = floor(1024/50) = 20

Number of pages = ceiling(number of records / number of records per block)

- ceiling function is required because it is not possible to read only a part of a block

Number of pages = ceiling(250,000/20) = 12,500

On average ceiling(12,500/2) = **6250 pages**



Heap file (unordered records)

- Advantage: Insertion of records is quick
- Disadvantage: searching/deleting records is slow



Sorted file (ordered records)

- Advantage: Searching/deleting records is quick
- Disadvantage: Inserting records is slow



How many pages/blocks to be read to find a record while the ordered field value is used to search given:

- Table with 250,000 records
- Per size 50 bytes
- Records are sorted (on one of the attributes)
- Block size 1024 bytes

Number of records per page = floor(1024/50) = 20

Number of pages = ceiling(250,000/20) = 12,500

- To search ceiling(log_2(12,500)) = 14

# Index

- A sorted file
- 2 attributes
  - Search field
  - Page number
- Sorted on the search field
  - Allows us to use binary search
- 2 types of indexes:
  - Primary index
    - Built on sorted key field
  - Secondary index
    - Built on any unordered attribute

- Number of records/page in index will be much more  than that of the original table
- Index has only two attributes
- Number of records in index may be less than these in original table
