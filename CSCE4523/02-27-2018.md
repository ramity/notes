# Data redundancy creates data anomaly

- Insertion anomaly
- Deletion anomaly
- Modification anomaly

---

- First Normal form (1NF):
  - A table can neither have multivalued attributes nor have composite attributes.
  - Only single valued and simple attributes allowed

- Functional dependency:

  - An attribute A2 is functionally dependent on attribute A1, if and only if one value of A1 gives exactly one value of A2.

  - That is, given two values of A2, we must have two values of A1.

  - That is, A1 uniquely determines A2.

  - [A1 is called the determinant]

  - Notation:

    - `A1 -> A2` (A2 is functionally dependent on A1)


| ID   | Name    | Age  |
| ---- | ------- | ---- |
| 1    | Ed      | 17   |
| 2    | Ed      | 21   |
| 3    | Francis | 21   |

Examples:

```
ID -> name
Name -/-> Age
ID -> Age
(ID, Age) -> Name
```
