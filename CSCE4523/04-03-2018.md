Task 5 details:

`create view XYZ as (select name, salary, address from employee where salary > 100,000);`

`select * from cat;`

//output shows XYZ as a view

Tables are saved as they are, views are never saved as they are populated on load.



//Look at view:

`Select * from XYZ;`

//the output of which is the query that is is saved as.



The sql query that defines the view is the view definition.



//For pretty printing the view definition, we must increase the number of characters shown by:

`Set long 150;`



`Select text from user.views where view.name="XYZ";`

Identification: Username

Authentication: Proving to the system who the user claims he/she is

- password, security question, finger print, iris scan, retina scan, voice, ... , what you know what you are, what you have.



Authorization: what the user is authorized to access:



| To access | Security model  |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Read      | Confidentiality |
| Write     | Integrity       |
| Execute   | Availability    |

Access control matrix:

| ---    | User 1 | User 2     |
| ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| File 1 | Read   | ---        |
| File 2 | ---    | Read/Write |
| File 3 | ---    | Write      |

Access control

- Discretionary access control (DAC)
  - The owner decides who can access and how
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
  - A group/board decides access to objects
  - Security classification:
    - TS -> Top secret
    - S -> Secret
    - C -> Confidential
    - U -> Unclassified



User (subjects) get clearance -> classification

Data (objects) are classified

- Access authorizations are granted as per clearances or classifications







Bell - La Padulla Mode:

- Simple security policy:
  - A subject S can read an object O if clearance of S >= classifications of O.





Example:

Mr X -> secret

Mr Y -> confidential



File 1 -> U

​	Can be read by both

File 2 -> S

​	Can only be read by Mr X



- *-Property
  - A subject S can write object O if clearance of S <= classification of O.



File 1 -> U

​	Neither can write to this file

File 2 -> S

​	Can be written by both



Missile table:

| ID   | Range | Quantity |
| ---- | ----- | -------- |
| 100  | 700   | 2000     |
| 105  | 800   | 1500     |
| 107  | 250   | 5000     |



Classification: At table level

The whole table is secret, or classified, or whatever



We can additionally classify the information at a row level by classifying 105 to TS and 107 to U.



We can also classify the information at a column level by classifying range as C and quantity as TS, etc



Lastly we can also classify the information at a data item level by hiding an entry at a specific row x col.





Missile table:

| ID   |      | Range |      | Quantity |      |
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- | -------- | ---- |
| 100  | U    | 700   | C    | 2000     | S    |
| 105  | U    | 800   | TS   | 1500     | S    |
| 107  | C    | 250   | C    | 5000     | TS   |



John -> C will see:



100

105

107		250



Sam -> S will see:



100		700		2000

105		---		1500

107		250		---
