# Relational Model

- Keys/super keys
- Candidate keys are a subset of superkeys
  - Minimal superkey
- Primary key
- Foreign key
  - Not a key
  - Refers to primary key of another table
- Integrity constraints
  - **Domain constraint**:
    - every attributes value must come from the attributes domain.
  - **Key constraint**:
    - key values must be unique for each table
  - **Entity integrity constraint**:
    - Primary key values must not be null.
  - **Referential Integrity constraint**:
    - A foreign key value, if not null, must be present in the primary key column of the table it refers to.
- Deleting a tuple whose primary key is referenced by a foreign key of another table.
  - Change corresponding foreign key value(s) to null.
  - Reassign the corresponding foreign key value(s) to some other value(s).
  - Delete those records.
    - May result in cascading deletion.

# Relational algebra

- Unary - Requires one table during operation

  - Select - not the same as SQL SELECT
  - Project

- Binary - Requires two or more tables during operation

  - **Union**
  - **Intersect**
  - **Difference**
  - Product
  - Join
  - Division

- Bolded require the two tables to be union compatible

- `Select -> G`

  - Select needs a condition -> selection condition filters tuples based on selection condition

- Example:

  - Employee

  - | ID   | Name  | Salary  |
    | ---- | ----- | ------- |
    | 1    | Jack  | $90,000 |
    | 2    | Jill  | $70,000 |
    | 3    | Mary  | $60,000 |
    | 5    | Steve | $20,000 |

    ```
    Statement:
      σ Employee
      salary > 50000 AND ...

    Returns:
      5, Steve, 20000
    ```

- Selection selectivity = number of tuples in result / number of tuples in original relation.

- ```
  0 <= σ <= cardinality of table (# tuples in table)
  ```
