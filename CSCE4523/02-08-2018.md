# Join

Notation: ><

- Technically 3 operations in one

  - Product, select, project

- Each table participating in a join operation must have a join attribute (same domain as the join attribute of the other table).

- Join operation displays records (from product operation) that have matching join attribute values

- Join selectivity = # of records in join result / # of records in product

- Join is commutative.

  - ```
    (R1 >< R2) = (R2 >< R1)
    ```

- ```
  |R1| = m
  |R2| = n
  0 <= (R1 >< R2) <= (m * n)
  ```
