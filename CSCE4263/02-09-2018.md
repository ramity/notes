- Implement all C++ 98 methods and disregard all methods that use or return allocator or iterator types.

- Report

  - Illustrate that I actually did the assignment and list all the things that I may have learned in the process of the assignment.

- Max_size should be designer defined. Therefore I have the power.

- Clear and erase both do NOT destory the array, but simply set the size/pointer/something to the start. Don't even bother with setting the array value to null. Erase function still works by moving values over.

- Size defines the number of used elements

- Capacity defines the number of all elements (used or not)

- ::operator= is called when a variable is set.

  - ```
    a = b;

    a is set to the pointer of b by calling b::operator=
    ```
