# Linked List

```c++
struct Node{
  int data;
  Node * next;
}
```

Say we call this struct inline to be ran as so:

```c++
Node n;
n.data = 10;
n.next = &n;

Node * p;
// NOTE: p is not initialized

cout << p->data;
```

What are the possible outputs of the cout statement above?

- 0
- 10
- Core dump
  - Seg fault
- ???

On a somewhat related note:

```c++
cout << p->data;
// is the same thing as
cout << (*p).data;
```

Now let's go back and fix our previous initialization problem:

```c++
Node n;
n.data = 10;
n.next = &n;

Node * p;
p = &n;
p->next = null;
p->data = 7;

cout << n->data;
// outputs 7
```

# Inserting a node into a linked list

```
// initialize pointers
Node * l;
Node * p;

// l points to p; p points to null
l->next = p;
p->next = null;

//say we want to insert an element inbetween l and p
Node * q;
q->next = l->next;
l->next = q;

```
