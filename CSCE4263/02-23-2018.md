# Early project description

Binary search tree with the following public methods:

```c++
search(int key);
bool insert(int key);
bool delete(int key);
void show();
int height();
int size();
bool check(); //check if tree is BST
```
---

# AVL tree

- Named after the person who wrote the paper describing an AVL tree.

- Rotation - Goal is to maintain the binary search tree

  - LL rotation (left left)

    - ```c++
      //Starting tree:

            C
           / \
          B   L4
         / \
        A   L3
       / \
      L1  L2

      //After LL rotation:

           B
         /   \
        A     C
       / \   / \
      L1 L2 L3 L4

      //Then we must check if the tree is balanced (ie. A < B < C)
      ```

  - LR rotation (left right)

    - ```c++
      //Starting tree:

            C
           / \
          A   L4
         / \
        L1  B
           / \
          L2 L3

      //After LR rotation:

           B
         /   \
        A     C
       / \   / \
      L1 L2 L3 L4

      //Then we must check if the tree is balanced (ie. A < B < C)
      ```

  - RR rotation (right right)

    - ```c++
      //Starting tree:

        A
       / \
      L1  B
         / \
        L2  C
           / \
          L3 L4

      //After LR rotation:

           B
         /   \
        A     C
       / \   / \
      L1 L2 L3 L4

      //Then we must check if the tree is balanced (ie. A < B < C)
      ```

  - RL rotation (right left)

    - ```c++
      //Starting tree:

            A
           / \
          L1  C
             / \
            B  L4
           / \
          L2 L3

      //After LR rotation:

           B
         /   \
        A     C
       / \   / \
      L1 L2 L3 L4

      //Then we must check if the tree is balanced (ie. A < B < C)
      ```
