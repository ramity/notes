# Operators and their overloading

- There are many operators
  - Operators have precedence, and association rules.
  - They have particular meanings in their original roles
  - Most of them can be overloaded, except for 4.
- Where to find all the operators and related information
  - Appendix B of the textbook

- Overloading operators
  - Notation convenience 
  - Give new meaning to operators
  - Overloaded operators are basically functions (general or member function), defined and invoked with special syntax.
  - The precedence and association rule and the number of operands cannot be changed when an operator is overloaded.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << 5;
    cout << "\n";
    {//scope breaks namespace
        int cout = 10;
        cout = cout << 5;
    	std::cout << cout;
    }
}
//outputs
//5
//350
```

- Function definition for two arguments
  - void function_name(type a1, type a2){}
  - return_type function_name(type a1, type a2){}
- Binary operator definition
  - void operator/binary_operator(type a1, type a2){}
  - return_type operator binary_operator(type a1, type a2){}
  - void operator + (type a1, type a2){}
  - return_type operator + (type a1, type a2){}
  - For member function, one of the argument is the object, so we have
    - return_type operator + (type a2){}
- Function invocation (calling)
  - Function_name(actual1, actual2);
- Operator invocation  (calling)
  - actual1 binary_operator actual2;
  - Treat operator binary operators as the name of the function and transform "actual1 binary_operator actual2" to
  - operator binary_operator (actual1, actual2);
  - or for member function, to actual1.opperator binary_operator(actual2)
