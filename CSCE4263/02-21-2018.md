# AVL Tree

- A binary search tree with additional properties:

  - Empty is AVL

  - ```
    //the height difference between the left and right
    //subtree must at most be 1 to be an AVL tree:

    |h(left subtree) - h(right subtree)| <= 1
    ```

    - both left subtree and right subtree are AVL trees.

- Balance factor

  - Defined as `height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)`

- Question: What is the minimum number of nodes (n) to achieve a given height (h) for an AVL tree.

  - ```
    N(h) = n
    ..........
    N(0) = 0
    N(1) = 1
    N(2) = 2
    N(3) = 4
    N(4) = 7
    N(5) = 12
    N(6) = 20
    N(7) = 33
    ..........
    N(h) = Fibbonaci(h + 2) - 1
    Fn(x) = Fn(x - 1) + Fn(x - 2)
    ```
