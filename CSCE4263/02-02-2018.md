# Advanced Data Structures

```c++
class vectorInt
{
  private:
  	int * buf;      // points the storage that holds the array
  	int num; 	    // number of elements in array
  	int capacity;	// size of the array
}
```

Two perspectives when using this class:

- Outside
  - Seen by the user of the class
- Inside
  - Seen by the developer of the class

```c++
int x[10]; // the type of x is int *
int * p = x;
p[0] = 5;
cout << x[0]; // outputs 5
```
