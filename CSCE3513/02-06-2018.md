# Agile software development

---

# What started this?

- Winston Royce writes first formal description in 1970 (waterfall methodology).
- Not very flexible
  - Very difficult and costly to predict all requirements of a system ahead of time.
  - Customer doesn't always know what they want ahead of time.
  - Demands of business changes.
  - Subsequent phases inform prior.
  - Divergent product expectations.

# The Agile Manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
