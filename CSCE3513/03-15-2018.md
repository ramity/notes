# Clean Code

- Rules vs Guidelines
- It is inconvenient and it requires effort and discipline, but it makes life so much easier as the code base grows.

---

# Comments

- You should use them sparingly
  - Comments have a tendency to go stale as code is updated
    - Generally end up being clutter or even misinformation
  - If you practice the principles of clean code then generally your code should be enough of a description of what is happening.
- Avoid redundant comments. Waste of time, among other things.
- When to comment
  - Tricky pieces of code
  - Amplify seemingly inconsequential pieces of code
  - When your other professors require it
    - As you transition out of school you should expect your comments to be reduced significantly.

# Exceptions

- Use unchecked exceptions
  - Don't have to explicitly handle the exception
  - Checked exceptions of java violate the open/close principle
    - Exceptions at the bottom of a call stack necessitate changing method signatures all the way up the chain between the throwing code and the catch

---

# Null values

- Don't return NULL
- Don't pass NULL
  - Passing null makes it look like a flag parameter
  - Refactor your method(s)

---

# Classes

- A module should not know about the inner details of an object it manipulates
- More precisely - a method f of class C should only call the methods of these...
  - C
  - Object created by f
  - Object passed as an argument to f
  - An object held in an instance variable of C

# Law of Demeter

- Advantage
  - When followed creates loosely coupled code that enhances maintainability and adaptability
- Disadvantages
  - Can lead to lots of wrapper methods and thus "wide" interfaces

---

# Classes

- Classes should be small
  - We don't count lines like we did for functions. Instead we count responsibilities.
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - A class or module should have one, and only one, reasons to change
    - Definition of responsibility
    - Guideline for class size

---

# SRP

- Complaint: Many, small, single-purpose classes make it difficult to understand the big picture
- Isn't valid
  - Same number of moving parts
  - Same amount to learn
  - Maybe a little more metadata (function names)
- Every sizable system will contain a large amount of logic and complexity
- The primary goal in managing such complexity is to organize it so that a developer knows where to look to find things.

---

# Classes

- Cohesion:
  - Classes should have a small number of instance variables
  - Each of the methods of a class should manipulate one or more of these variables
  - The more variables a method manipulates the more cohesive that method is to its class
  - Strive towards maximum cohesion
- Isolating from change (decoupling)
  - Dependency Inversion Principle
  - Primarily the liberal use of interfaces allows us to decouple the use of a class from its concrete implementation
    - Facilitates testing
    - Enables Dependency Infection (DI)
    - Allows implementation swapping

# Emergent Design

- Runs all the tests
  - A system that is comprehensively tested and passes all of its tests all of the time is a testable system
  - The more tests we write, the more we use principles like DIP and tools like DI interfaces and abstractions to minimize coupling
    - It is hard to test unclean code
- Refactoring
  - Tests empowers to keep our code and classes clean by incrementally refactoring the code
  - Allows us to follow the Boy Scout rule because we can make modoifications with confidence
- Expressiveness
  - Major cost of a software project is in long-term maintencance
  - Spaghetti code is the antithesis of expressiveness
    - Self feeding system
      - Takes a long time to understand and is difficult to correctly modify

# Smells and Heuristics

- Commented out code
  - When you see commented out code, delete it!
  - Rely on the verion control system
    - GIT
  - Dead functions
    - Methods that are never called should be discarded
    - Rely on the version control system
  - Incorrect behavior at the boundaries
    - Be careful to define and test all the corner and boundary cases
- Encapsulate conditionals
  - When your logic has many conditions move it to an appropriately named method
  - When your conditional needs additional context move it...
