# Sensors for mobile robots

- Why should a robotics engineer know about sensors?
  - They are the key components for perceiving the environment
  - Understanding the physical principles enables appropriate use
- Understanding the physical principle behind sensors enables us:
  - To properly select the sensors for a given application
  - To properly model the sensor system, e.g. resolution, bandwidth, uncertainties

# Dealing with real world situations

- Reasoning about a situation
- Cognitive systems have to interpret situations based on uncertain and only partially available information
- They need ways to learn functional and contextual information (semantics/understanding)
  - Concept known as probabilistic reasoning

# Classification of sensors

- What:
  - Proprioceptive sensors
    - MEasures values internally to the system (robot)
    - motor speed, wheel load, heading of the robot, battery status, etc
  - Exteroceptive sensors
    - information from the robots environment
    - distance to objects, intensity of the ambient light, unique features.
  - Passive sensors
    - Measure engergy coming from the environment; very much influenced by the environment
  - Active sensors
    - Emit their proper energy and measure the reaction
    - Better performance, but some influenced on the environment

# Encoders

- Definition
  - electro-mechanical device that converts linear or angular position of a shaft to an analog or digital signal, making it an linear/angular transducer

---

# Wheel/Motor encoders

- Use cases
  - measure position or speed of the wheels or steering
  - Integrate wheel movements to get an estimate of the position (odometry)
  - Optical encoders are proprioceptive sensors
  - Typical resolutions 64-2048 increments per revolution
  - for high resolution: interpolation
- Working principle of optical encoders
  - Regular: counts the number of transitions but cannot tell the direction of motion
  - Quadrature: uses two sensors in quadrature-phase shift. The ordering of which wave produces a rising edge first tells the direction of motion. Additionally, resolution is 4 times bigger
  - A single slot in the outer track generates a reference pulse per revolution.
