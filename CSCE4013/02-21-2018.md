# Perspective Camera

- How does the world map to pixels in the image?
- For convenience, the image plane is usually represented in front of the camera lens such that the image preserves the same orientation (i.e. not flipped).
- Note: a camera does not measure distances but angles!
  - A camera is a "bearing sensor"

# Measuring distances with cameras

- Structures from stereo (stereo vision)
- Computationally difficult and suffers from inability to perform in fog, night, and heavy downfall.

# Stereo vision - the simplified case

- An ideal, simplified case assumes both  cameras are identical and are aligned with the x-axis.
