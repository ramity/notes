Autonomous Robot Systems

# Selection of Locomotion Concept

- Wheeled motion is
  - Highly efficient on hard and flat surfaces (usually manmade)
- Generally restricted to manmade structures
- The de-facto standard for mobile robotics

---

# Review: Dimensionality

- The degree of freedom (DOF) of a workspace is its overall dimensionality
  - On flat ground, DOF = 3
  - In the air or below water, DOF = 6
- For a robotic system DDOF <= Sm <= DOF
  - DOF is its ability to achieve various poses
  - DDOF is its ability to achieve various velocities
- Kinematics
  - The subfield of mechanics dealing with motions of bodies
- Forward kinematics
  - Given is a set of actuator positions
  - Determine corresponding referencce pose
- Inverse kinematics
  - Given is a desired reference pose
  - Determine corrsponding actuator positions
- Wheels
  - Are often subject to motion constraints
  - Often do not allow to compute kinematics directly
- Consequently, for most wheeled robots, actuator positions do not map to unique reference poses
  - There is no direct way to measure a robot's positon
  - Position must be integrated over time, depends on the path taken
- Understanding mobile robotic motion required an understanding of wheel constraints placed on the robot's mobility.

# Holonomic systems

- Diff equation of E^1 are integrable to the final position

---

# Non-holonomic systems

- Diff equation to E^1 are not integrable to the final position
- The measure of the traveled distances of each wheel is not sufficient to calculate the final position
- Knowledge of the movement as a function of time becomes necessary

---

# Homogeneous Transformation

- Represents of differential forward kinematics
  - Mapping velocities between two frames

---

# Assumptions

- Movement on a horizontal plane
- Point contact of the wheels
- Wheels not deformable
- Pure rolling, no slipping, skidding or sliding
- No friction for rotation around contact point
- Wheels connected to a rigid frame (chassis)

---

# Standard and Castor Wheels

- Standard wheels
  - Two degrees of freedom
  - Rotation around the motorized wheel axle and the contact point
- Castor wheel
  - Three degrees of freedom
  - Rotation around the wheel axle, the contact point, and the castor axle.

---

# Swedish and Spherical Wheels

- Swedish wheel
  - Three degrees of freedom
  - Rotation around the motorized wheel axle, around the rollers, and around the contact point
- Spherical wheels (ball)
  - Three degrees of freedom
  - Suspension technically not solved

---

# Wheel arrangements

- Given a wheeled robot
  - Each wheel imposes >= 0 constraints on its motion
  - Only fixed and steerable standard wheels impose no-sliding constraints
- Stability requirements
  - At least 3 wheels in ground contact
  - That CoG lies within support triangle
- Stability is improved by 4 or more wheels
  - Such arrangement are hyper static
  - Necessitates a flexible suspension system
