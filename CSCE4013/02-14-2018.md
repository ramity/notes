# One picture, a thousand words

- Vision is our most powerful sense in aiding our perception of the 3D world around us.
- Retina is ~1000mm^2. Contains millions of photoreceptors
- Provides enormous amount of information: data-rate of ~3GB/s
  - A large proportion of our brain power is dedicated to processing the signals from our eyes.

# Human visual capabilities

- Our visual system is very sophisticated
- Humans can interpret images successfully under a wide range of conditions.

# Vision for robotics

- Enormous descript ability of images
  - A lot of data to process
  - Not sensible to copy the biology but learn from it
- Cameras:
  - Capture light => convert to digital image => process to get salient information
  - Vision is increasingly popular as a sensing modality:
    - Compactness
    - Compatibility
    - Low cost
    - HW advances necessary to support the processing of images
