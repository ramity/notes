# Key Questions

- The three key questions in Mobile Robotics
  - Where am I?
  - Where am I going?
  - How do I get there?
- Model of the environment (given or autonomously built)
- Perceive and analyze the environment
- Find its position/situation within the environment
- Plan and execute the movement

# Generic Control Scheme

- Control loop
  - Dynamically changing environment
  - No compact model available
  - Many sources of uncertainties
- Two approaches
  - Classical AI
    - Complete modeling
    - Model based
    - Horizaontal deccomposition
  - New AI, AL
    - Sparse or no modeling
    - Behavior based
    - Vertical decomposition
    - Bottom up

# Environment Representation and Modeling

- Environment Representation
  - Continuous Metric
    - x,y,`theta`
  - Discrete Metric
    - metric grid
  - Discrete Topological
    - Toploical grid
- Environment Modeling
  - Raw senor data, e.g laser range data, grayscale images
    - Large volume of data, low distinctiveness
    - Makes use of all acquired information
  - Low level features, e.g. line other geometric features
    - Medium volume of data, average distinctiveness
    - Filters out the useful information,, still ambiguties
  - High level features, e.g. doors, a car, the Eiffel tower
    - Low volume of data, high distinctiveness
    - Filters out the useful information, few/no ambiguities, not enough information

    - Learned
- Features
  - Models/Semantics
    - Imposed
    - Learned
- Objects
  - ...
- Places / Situations

# Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV)

- Invented in 1950s
- Most developed market now
- Sales $300 million in US in 2005
- Designed to move materials
- Work in factories, warehouses, shipping areas.
- Big users are auto parts, newspapers
- Guidance
  - Wire - induce cross-track error
  - Inertial - plus magnets
  - Laser - plus reflectors
- Invented modern systems are controlled wirelessly
  - Central traffic management computer
  - Allocates space to individuals
- Three configurations common:
  - Forked
  - Tug (tow/tractor)
  - Unit load
- Warehouses of the future are robots
  - Kiva inverts order picking
  - The racks come to the people

# Service robots

- Earliest use of robotics in Health Care in 1970s
- Helpmate Robot used in US in 1990s
- Move bio samples, bio waste, linens, medical records.
- About 50 were sold
- Aethon (pittsburg)
- Materials transport costs $3 million a year in labor
- RN's are involved too much in doing his.
- Robots rent for $1500 per month.

# Social / Entertainment

- Wowee Robsapiens
  - Hong Kong company
  - $100
- Walks, dances, does karate moves, pick things up, and throw them, explains
- Sold more than 2 million worldwide the first year

---

# Humanoids

- Hope is to replace humans in doing hard labor

---

# Field robots

- Do a useful task in structured or natural settings
- Forceful interaction with the environment via implements
- Applications include:
  - Planting 
  - Weeding
  - Chemical application
  - Pruning
  - Harvesting
  - etc
