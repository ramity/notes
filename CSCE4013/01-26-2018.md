# Static Locomotion

- Static locomotion
- Characteristics
  - Body weight supported by at least three legs
  - CoG (center of gravity) with support triangle
  - Safe, slow, and inefficient
- Most widespread static sequence with 6 legs

---

# Dynamic Locomotion

- Dynamic Locomotion
- Characteristics
  - The robot falls unless it...
- In principle only dynamic walking feasible
- Large feet allow for static walking

---

# Forward Kinematics

- Forward kinematics
  - Given is a set of joint angles
  - Determine the resulting end-effector position
- Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) reference frame layout

---

# Inverse Kinematics

- Given is a desired end-effector position
- Determine corresponding joint angles
- Problem is non-trivial and generally not well-posed.
  - No solution, One solution, >1 solution
- For 2 link manipulators employ cosine law.
