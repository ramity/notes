# Global Positioning System (GPS)

- Facts
  - Became accessible for commercial applications in 1995
  - Initially there were 24 satellites orbiting the earth every 12 hours at a hight of 20.190km
  - 4 satellites were located in each of 6 orbits with 60 degrees oreination between each other
- Working principle
  - Location of any GPS receiver is determined through a time of flight measurement (satellites send orbital location (ephemeris) plus time; the receiver computes its location though trilateration and time correction).
- Technical challenges
  - Time synchronization between the individual satellites and the GPS receiver
  - Real time update of the exact location of the satellites
  - Precise measurement of the time of flight
  - Interferences with other signals
- Time synchronization
  - atomic clocks on each satellite
  - monitoring them from different ground stations
- Ultra-precision time synchronization is extremely important
  - electromagnetic radiation propgates at light speed
- Light speed travels roughly 0.3 m per nanosecond
- Errors
  - Ephemeris data errors - 1 meter
  - Tropospheric delays - 1 meter
  - Unmodeled ionosphere delays: 10 meters
  - Multipath: 0.5 - 100 meters
  - Number of satellites under line of sight

# Differential GPS

- DGPS requires that a GPS receiver, known as the base station be set up on a precisely known location. The base station receiver calculates its position based on satellite signals and compares this location to the known location. The difference is applied to the GPS data recorded by the roving GPS receiver
- Position accuracies in sub-meter to cm range

# Range sensors

- Sonar
- Laser range finder
- Time of Flight camera
- Structured light
- Large range distance measurement
- Key element for localization and environment modeling
- Ultrasonic sensors as well as laser range sensors make use of propagation speed of sound or electromagnetic waves respectively.
