# Bringing new ideas to the project workflow

- integrated "task poker". On tasks, comments should be labeled to better explain their contents.

  - Specify clarification request

  - Similarly to arcanist, a git wrapper will allow for a better, but more opinionated, git experience.

    - I suppose raft would be a good name. Short for rafter of course.

    - ```
      raft add .
      # calls git add .

      raft review
      # creates review if none found from currently accessed branch against master

      raft review origin develop
      # creates review if none found from currently accessed branch against remote branch 'develop'

      raft review create origin develop
      # creates review from currently accessed branch against remote branch 'develop'

      raft review update origin develop
      # updates review from currently accessed branch against remote branch 'develop'

      # raft diff calls nano/vim (required deps) to create a diff. Very similar to arcanist.
      ```

    - Linters will be something that will need to be researched into significantly as this project develops.

      - As far as I've seen with the little research I've done thus far, it seems I could easily make a .raftlint file similar to .arclint to call an executable any time a user is technically pushing to the configured truss host. That may be the best course of action for the time being.
